# Lecture 2

The assigned reading for today is not a paper, but the [Online Go tutorial](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1).
The assigned "question" is the [Crawler exercise](https://go.dev/tour/concurrency/10) in the tutorial.
Also, take a look at Go's [RPC package](https://pkg.go.dev/net/rpc), which you will use in lab 1.
