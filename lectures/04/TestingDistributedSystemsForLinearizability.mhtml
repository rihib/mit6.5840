Distributed systems are challenging to implement correctly because they mus=
t
handle concurrency and failure. Networks can delay, duplicate, reorder, and
drop packets, and machines can fail at any time. Even when designs are prov=
en
correct on paper, it is difficult to avoid subtle bugs in implementations.<=

<p>Unless we want to use formal methods<sup><a href=3D"https://anishathalye=

s
if we want assurance that implementations are correct. Testing distributed
systems is challenging, too. Concurrency and nondeterminism make it difficu=

to catch bugs in tests, especially when the most subtle bugs surface only u=

scenarios that are uncommon in regular operation, such as simultaneous mach=

failure or extreme network delays.</p>

<p>Before we can discuss testing distributed systems for correctness, we ne=
ed to
define what we mean by =E2=80=9Ccorrect=E2=80=9D. Even for seemingly simple=
 systems, specifying
exactly how the system is supposed to behave is an involved
process<sup><a href=3D"https://anishathalye.com/testing-distributed-systems=
-for-linearizability/#user-content-fn-specs-for-real-systems" id=3D"user-co=
ntent-fnref-specs-for-real-systems" data-footnote-ref=3D"true" aria-describ=
edby=3D"footnote-label">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Consider a simple key-value store, similar to <a rel=3D"noopener" href=
=3D"https://github.com/coreos/etcd">etcd</a>, that maps strings to
strings and supports two operations: <code>Put(key, value)</code> and <code=
>Get(key)</code>. First,
we consider how it behaves in the sequential case.</p>
<div class=3D"FancyHeading_parent__sRaCj"><div class=3D"FancyHeading_spacer=

Sequential Specifications</h2></div>
<p>We probably have a good intuitive understanding of how a key-value store=
 is
supposed to behave under sequential operation: <code>Get</code> operations =
must reflect
the result of applying all previous <code>Put</code> operations. For exampl=
e, we could run
a <code>Put("x", "y")</code> and then a subsequent <code>Get("x")</code> sh=
ould return <code>"y"</code>. If the
operation returned, say, a <code>"z"</code>, that would be incorrect.</p>
<p>More formal than an English-language description, we can write a specifi=
cation
for our key-value store as executable code:</p>
<pre style=3D"display:block;overflow-x:auto;padding:0.5em;color:#2f3337;bac=

<p>The code is short, but it nails down all the important details: the star=
t
state, how the internal state is modified as a result of operations, and wh=
at
values are returned as a result of calls on the key-value store. The spec
solidifies some details like what happens when <code>Get()</code> is called=
 on a
nonexistent key, but in general, it lines up with our intuitive definition =
of a
key-value store.</p>
<div class=3D"FancyHeading_parent__sRaCj"><div class=3D"FancyHeading_spacer=

ility</h2></div>
<p>Next, we consider how our key-value store can behave under concurrent
operation. Note that the sequential specification does <strong>not</strong>=
 tell us what
happens under concurrent operation. For example, the sequential spec doesn=
=E2=80=99t
say how our key-value store is allowed to behave in this scenario:</p>
<div><div style=3D"width:min(100%, 600px)" class=3D"ScaleBox_outer__Yaw8a "=

 600 * 100%)"><div class=3D"hide-without-js"><div><div class=3D"Image_trans=
itionBlur__CN_L_ Image_noBlur__yboG5"><div class=3D"Image_placeholder__REjR=

4601d9978b6010/operation-1.svg" width=3D"600" height=3D"400"></picture></di=
v></div></div></div></div></div>
<p>It=E2=80=99s not immediately obvious what value the <code>Get("x")</code=
> operation should be
allowed to return. Intuitively, we might say that because the <code>Get("x"=
)</code> is
concurrent with the <code>Put("x", "y")</code> and <code>Put("x", "z")</cod=
e>, it can return either
value or even <code>""</code>. If we had a situation where another client e=
xecuted a
<code>Get("x")</code> much later, we might say that the operation must retu=
rn <code>"z"</code>,
because that was the value written by the last write, and the last write
operation was not concurrent with any other writes.</p>
<p>We formally specify correctness for concurrent operations based on a seq=
uential
specification using a consistency model known as
<a rel=3D"noopener" href=3D"https://cs.brown.edu/~mph/HerlihyW90/p463-herli=
hy.pdf"><strong>linearizability</strong></a>. In a linearizable system, <st=
rong>every
operation appears to execute atomically and instantaneously at some point
between the invocation and response</strong>. There are other consistency m=
odels
besides linearizability, but many distributed systems provide linearizable
behavior: linearizability is a strong consistency model, so it=E2=80=99s re=
latively
easy to build other systems on top of linearizable systems.</p>
<p>Consider an example history with invocations and return values of operat=
ions on
a key-value store:</p>
<div><div style=3D"width:min(100%, 600px)" class=3D"ScaleBox_outer__Yaw8a "=

v></div></div></div></div>
<p>This history <strong>is linearizable</strong>. We can show this by expli=
citly finding
linearization points for all operations (drawn in orange below). The induce=
d
sequential history, <code>Put("x", "0")</code>, <code>Get("x") -&gt; "0"</c=
ode>, <code>Put("x", "1")</code>,
<code>Get("x") -&gt; "1"</code>, is a correct history with respect to the s=
equential
specification.</p>
<div><div style=3D"width:min(100%, 600px)" class=3D"ScaleBox_outer__Yaw8a "=

<p>In contrast, this history is <strong>not</strong> linearizable:</p>

<p>There is no linearization of this history with respect to the sequential
specification: there is no way to assign linearization points to operations=
 in
this history. We could start assigning linearization points to the operatio=
ns
from clients 1, 2, and 3, but then there would be no way to assign a
linearization point for client 4: it would be observing a stale value.
Similarly, we could start assigning linearization points to the operations =
from
clients 1, 2, and 4, but then the linearization point of client 2=E2=80=99s=
 operation
would be after the start of client 4=E2=80=99s operation, and then we would=
n=E2=80=99t be able
to assign a linearization point for client 3: it could legally only read a
value of <code>""</code> or <code>"0"</code>.</p>

<p>With a solid definition of correctness, we can think about how to test
distributed systems. The general approach is to test for correct operation
while randomly injecting faults such as machine failures and network
partitions. We could even simulate the entire network so it=E2=80=99s possi=
ble to do
things like cause extremely long network delays. Because tests are randomiz=
ed,
we would want to run them a bunch of times to gain assurance that a system
implementation is correct.</p>
<div class=3D"FancyHeading_parent__sRaCj"><div class=3D"FancyHeading_spacer=
__ZuXX3 FancyHeading_spacer2__Mp82L"><div class=3D"FancyHeading_box__qoAZj =
FancyHeading_box2__fmBrr"></div></div><h2 id=3D"ad-hoc-testing">Ad-hoc test=
ing</h2></div>
<p>How do we actually test for correct operation? With the simplest softwar=
e, we
test it using input-output cases like <code>assert(expected_output =3D=3D f=
(input))</code>. We
could use a similar approach with distributed systems. For example, with ou=
r
key-value store, we could have the following test where multiple clients ar=
e
executing operations on the key-value store in parallel:</p>
<pre style=3D"display:block;overflow-x:auto;padding:0.5em;color:#2f3337;bac=
kground:#f6f6f6;overflow:auto"><code class=3D"language-text" style=3D"white=
-space:pre"><span><span>for client_id =3D 0..10 {
</span></span><span>    spawn thread {
</span><span>        for i =3D 0..1000 {
</span><span>            value =3D rand()
</span><span>            kvstore.put(client_id, value)
</span><span>            assert(kvstore.get(client_id) =3D=3D value)
</span><span>        }
</span><span>    }
</span><span>}
</span><span>wait for threads
</span><span></span></code></pre>
<p>It is certainly the case that if the above test fails, then the key-valu=
e store
is not linearizable. However, this test is not that thorough: there are
non-linearizable key-value stores that would always pass this test.</p>
<div class=3D"FancyHeading_parent__sRaCj"><div class=3D"FancyHeading_spacer=
__ZuXX3 FancyHeading_spacer2__Mp82L"><div class=3D"FancyHeading_box__qoAZj =
FancyHeading_box2__fmBrr"></div></div><h2 id=3D"linearizability-1">Lineariz=
ability</h2></div>
<p>A better test would be to have parallel clients run <strong>completely r=
andom
operations</strong>: e.g. repeatedly calling <code>kvstore.put(rand(), rand=
())</code> and
<code>kvstore.get(rand())</code>, perhaps limited to a small set of keys to=
 increase
contention. But in this case, how would we determine what is =E2=80=9Ccorre=
ct=E2=80=9D
operation? With the simpler test, we had each client operating on a separat=
e
key, so we could always predict exactly what the output had to be.</p>
<p>When clients are operating concurrently on the same set of keys, things =
get
more complicated: we can=E2=80=99t predict what the output of every operati=
on has to be
because there isn=E2=80=99t only one right answer. So we have to take an al=
ternative
approach: we can test for correctness by recording an entire history of
operations on the system and then checking if the history is linearizable w=
ith
respect to the sequential specification.</p>

<p>A linearizability checker takes as input a sequential specification and =
a
concurrent history, and it runs a decision procedure to check whether the
history is linearizable with respect to the spec.</p>
<div class=3D"FancyHeading_parent__sRaCj"><div class=3D"FancyHeading_spacer=

<p>Unfortunately, linearizability checking is NP-complete. The proof is act=
ually
quite simple: we can show that linearizability checking is in NP, and we ca=
n
show that an NP-hard problem can be reduced to linearizability checking.
Clearly, linearizability checking is in NP: given a linearization, i.e. the
linearization points of all operations, we can check in polynomial time if =
it
is a valid linearization with respect to the sequential spec.</p>
<p>To show that linearizability checking is NP-hard, we can reduce the subs=

problem to linearizability checking. Recall that in the subset sum problem,=

<p>Even though linearizability checking is NP-complete, in practice, it can=
 work
pretty well on small histories. Implementations of linearizability checkers
take an executable specification along with a history, and they run a searc=
h
procedure to try to construct a linearization, using tricks to constrain th=
e
size of the search space.</p>
<p>There are existing linearizability checkers like <a rel=3D"noopener" hre=
f=3D"https://github.com/jepsen-io/knossos">Knossos</a>, which is used in
the <a rel=3D"noopener" href=3D"https://jepsen.io/">Jepsen</a> test system.=
 Unfortunately, when trying to test an implementation
of a distributed key-value store that I had written, I couldn=E2=80=99t get=
 Knossos to
check my histories. It seemed to work okay on histories with a couple
concurrent clients, with about a hundred history events in total, but in my
tests, I had tens of clients generating histories of thousands of events.</=
p>
<p>To be able to test my key-value store, I wrote <a rel=3D"noopener" href=
=3D"https://github.com/anishathalye/porcupine">Porcupine</a>, a fast
linearizability checker implemented in Go. Porcupine checks if histories ar=
e
linearizable with respect to executable specifications written in Go.
Empirically, Porcupine is thousands of times faster than Knossos. I was abl=
e to
use it to test my key-value store because it is capable of checking histori=
es
of thousands of events in a couple seconds.</p>

<p>Testing linearizable distributed systems using fault injection along wit=
h
linearizability checking is an effective approach.</p>
<p>To compare ad-hoc testing with linearizability checking using <a rel=3D"=
noopener" href=3D"https://github.com/anishathalye/porcupine">Porcupine</a>,=
 I
tried testing my distributed key-value store using the two approaches. I tr=
ied
introducing different kinds of design bugs into the implementation of the
key-value store, such as modifications that would result in stale reads, an=
d I
checked to see which tests failed. The ad-hoc tests caught some of the most
egregious bugs, but the tests were incapable of catching the more subtle bu=
gs.
In contrast, I couldn=E2=80=99t introduce a single correctness bug that the
linearizability test couldn=E2=80=99t catch.</p>

<p>Formal methods can provide strong guarantees about the
correctness of distributed systems. For example, the UW PLSE research group
has recently <a rel=3D"noopener" href=3D"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/285=
4065.2854081">verified</a> an implementation of the <a rel=3D"noopener" hre=
f=3D"https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">Raft</a> consensus
protocol using the Coq proof assistant. Unfortunately, verification
requires specialized knowledge, and verifying realistic systems involves
huge effort. Perhaps one day systems used in the real world will be proven
correct, but for now, production systems are tested but not verified. <a hr=
